People want to be sure that they’re making the right choice with the the right company. Your offerings aren’t that different from many other competitors, but it’s your “trustability” that will set you apart from the herd. 

The Tour Operators Reviews extension allows you to add reviews written by your previous guests and display them across your site, whether on the homepage, or one of the Tour Operator post type pages (accommodation, destinations and tours).
