# Specification Quality Checklist: Reviews Schema 2.0 Alignment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- schema.org property and type names (for example `Offer`, `itemOffered`, `sameAs`) are the external contract that search engines consume. They count as domain vocabulary here, not implementation detail.
- The "Context: Baseline on `update-2.2`" section names existing behaviour, so planning can focus on the remaining gaps. No PHP classes, hooks or functions are prescribed.
- Validator names (Schema.org Validator, Google Rich Results Test) are the agreed QA approach from the Linear ticket, not technology choices.
- FR-010 (Review `offers`) uses a recorded default instead of a [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker. Confirm it during `/speckit-clarify`.
- Validation passed on the first iteration. Ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
